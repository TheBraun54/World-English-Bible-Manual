# World English Bible (WEB)

This repository contains the full text of the World English Bible (WEB), converted into well-structured Markdown format. The goal of this project is to make the WEB Bible easier to read, edit, and integrate into markdown-friendly tools and environments, such as Obsidian.

Each book is formatted with readable headers, consistent structure, and clean syntax â€” perfect for developers, content creators, or anyone who prefers working with Markdown.
