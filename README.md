# World English Bible (WEB)
Version (1.0.0)

This repository contains the full text of the World English Bible (WEB), converted into well-structured Markdown format. I decided to use the World English Bible because it's in the public domain, which means people won't have to deal with any copyright issues. The goal of this project is to make the WEB Bible easier to read, edit, and integrate into markdown-friendly tools and environments, such as Obsidian.

Each book is formatted with readable headers, consistent structure, and clean syntax â€” perfect for developers, content creators, or anyone who prefers working with Markdown.

## Starting Goal
- Convert WEB Bible to markdown text
  - Chapter Verse notes (Each verse has separate page)
  - Chapter notes (Whole chapter for one page)
- Canonical Definitions
- Add different ways to read the bible

## Future Enhancement Ideas
- Add lexicon
  - Greek
  - Hebrew
  - Aramaic?
  - Latin?
- Topographical Bible
